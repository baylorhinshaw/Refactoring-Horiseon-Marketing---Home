# Refactoring-Horiseon-Marketing-Home
Horiseon Marketing - Home html and css is refactored.
In these files I have gone through and refactored and cleaned up the css and the html while also adding comments. Also practiced using class and id to help consolidate the code further more.
This is homework for week 1.
